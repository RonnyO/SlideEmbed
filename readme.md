SlideEmbed is a universal embed controls bar for web presentations.
This means from now on bloggers could embed your modern web-based presentation (e.g. CSS3D Slideshow by @hakimel , CSSS by @leaverou).

Just include SlideEmbed.js in your presentation and you're good to go. (well, at least when 0.1 will be ready)

Initial POC is [here](http://jsfiddle.net/Ronny/AVcRc/9/).
